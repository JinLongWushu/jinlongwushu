title: How to join?
---

You can just turn up to any of the classes that are listed on our timetable either to just watch or join the training session. As a member of BCCMA and to protect us as well as our students, we require every person who wishes to join to obtain a membership which includes insurance and other benefits of becoming a member with a recognised body. We give 3 weeks trial period during which classes are priced at memberâ€™s price. If after two weeks the applications are not returned, the classes are charged at non-member price.
