title: What are the differences in training between China and foreign countries?
---

The main difference is that in China most martial arts schools are for people who wish to train to become professionals. The method of training is therefore more intense and they usually train all day every day. On the other hand, many martial arts schools outside China are more relaxed where many practice for improving fitness and wellbeing. Most train once a week and each class lasts between one to two hours. At Jin Long we maintain a good balance of friendly and relaxed yet dedicated and productive training. The class is run as how it would be in China (but may be less intense!) and each student is given the instructions, advice and encouragement to support their individual motive for training.
