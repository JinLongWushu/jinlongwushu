title: Can Chinese martial arts (wushu) be applied for self-defence?
---

The objective of Chinese Martial Arts essentially is to strengthen peopleâ€™s physical condition and skill in self defence. The individual movements were derived from the techniques and skills used for self-defence and fighting for survival. Various movements and techniques have since then been modified, evolved and divided in to different styles which can be categorised in to external or internal. Nowadays, the different styles and all kinds of forms we practice are actually all the individual actions that are linked together, in order to be more convenient and easier to practice.

There is a common misunderstanding however, that Wushu is only performed beautifully with strong emphasis on artistic performances and that it is not able to be applied in real fighting. (The answer is in the question below).
