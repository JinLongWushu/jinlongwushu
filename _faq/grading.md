title: Do we have grading system?
---

We have our own unique grading system based on that in China which has been adjusted to suit here in the UK. Our grading scheme is designed purely to encourage our students (especially children), forming references to their individual achievements whilst maintaining our unique learning process. We hold an annual grading test usually at the end of the year. It is not compulsory to take grade tests, but it offers our students a good chance to see how much they have learned and improved through yearâ€™s training.
