title: How old can children start to do Wushu training?

This largely depends on individuals, although we have children as young as 5 with us. We advise that they have abilities to listen, concentrate and get on with others. We do have special childrenâ€™s classes and we have recently started a family class where young children can learn with their parents or their older siblings which is proving popular and successful as they are more likely to feel safe and are able to follow instructions better.
