			I do hereby give my permission for my participation in tai chi classes through Zoom. I further authorise the rendering of any medical treatment that may become necessary due to my participation in this class.

		<p>By signing this waiver, I acknowledge that this is a physically intense tai chi class, am in good health and able to participate. I have visited a licensed physician within the past 6 months and have been cleared to practice tai chi. I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to inform my tai chi instructor of any pre-existing medical conditions or injuries that may impact my practice.
		</p>

			In consideration of the permission granted to me to participate in tai chi classes, I do hereby agree, on my own behalf, to release Jin Long, its founders, administrators, employees, representatives, and volunteers, from any and all actions, causes of action, damages, claims, or demands of whatever kind of nature which I may have for injuries, known or unknown, which are incurred by, arise from, or in any way relate to my participation in this tai chi class. I realise that I am participating in tai chi at my own risk. My signature is binding to this liability waiver from this day forth. I have read this release and fully understand the terms.
