			A Manchester based Culture Events Company and Martial Arts School.

		<p>Jinlong Culture &amp; Performing Arts Ltd was set up by Deqing Chen with a view to expand and broaden the range and reach of Chinese classical and contemporary arts in the UK. We have been actively promoting Chinese cultural arts by providing performances, workshops, demonstrations and teaching high quality genuine Chinese Martial Arts to children and adults.</p>
		<p>Already well established in the North West, we are committed to introducing a diverse range of Chinese culture to the UK, bringing the two cultures together through the medium of heritage and arts.</p>

		<h2>Martial Arts – Wushu &amp; Tai Chi</h2>
		<p>Jinlong also runs a professional martial arts academy, established in 1999, teaching genuine contemporary Chinese Wushu (more commonly known as Kung Fu), Weapons, Sanda (Chinese Kickboxing), Qigong and Taiji to people of all ages and levels. Through the medium of martial arts, we aim to provide an environment where the qualities of family, self- discipline, respect and personal growth are able to thrive within all our students.</p>
		<p>We are an official member of the BCCMA (British Council for Chinese Martial Arts) and regularly participate in competitions both in the UK and all over the world. Our achievements include a representative on the National British Team as well as gold, silver and bronze medals in international and open competitions.</p>
