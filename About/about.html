			Jin Long Martial Arts Academy is a professional Martial Arts Academy, established in 1999 by Master Chen De Qing.
		</p>
		<p>We teach genuine contemporary Chinese Wushu (more commonly known as Kung Fu), Weapons, Sanda (Chinese Kickboxing), Qigong and Taiji to people of all ages and levels. Through the medium of martial arts, we aim to provide an environment where the qualities of family, self- discipline, respect and personal growth are able to thrive within all our students.</p>
		<p>We are an official member of the BCCMA (British Council for Chinese Martial Arts) and regularly participate in competitions both in the UK and all over the world. Our achievements include a representative on the National British Team as well as gold, silver and bronze medals in international and open competitions.</p>
		<p>We are regularly involved within the community, aiming to introduce, showcase and integrate Chinese culture within Greater Manchester. We are the main organizer and sponsor of the annual professional theatre production of Chinese New Year Spectacular run by Stockport Council, as well as Chinese New Year Celebrations in the Trafford Centre and Manchester China Town. We also give reputable workshops within multiple primary and secondary schools within the local areas of where we teach.</p>
